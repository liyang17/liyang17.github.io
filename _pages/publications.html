### Journal Articles
1. **Thermal Performance of Packed-Bed Latent Heat Storage Tank Integrated with Flat-Plate Collectors Under Intermittent Loads of Building Heating**  
   Jiatao Liu, Shilei Lyu*  
   *Energy*, Apr. 2024  
   [DOI: 10.1016/j.energy.2024.04.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.04.001)  
   **Abstract**: This study investigates the thermal performance of a packed-bed latent heat storage tank integrated with flat-plate solar collectors for building heating applications. The intermittent load conditions are analyzed to optimize the system's efficiency.

2. **Optimal Design of Air Distribution Systems in Large Indoor Spaces During the Construction of Walls: A Case Study on Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal Storage Tanks**  
   Yan Ding*, Xiao Pan, Xiong Shen, Jianbo Lai, Yan Zhu, Jiatao Liu, Jobaier, Faezeh Pishahang  
   *Journal of Building Engineering*, May. 2024  
   [DOI: 10.1016/j.jbe.2024.05.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbe.2024.05.002)  
   **Abstract**: This paper presents an optimal design methodology for air distribution systems in large indoor spaces, focusing on the construction of liquefied natural gas terminal storage tanks. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to validate the design.

3. **Quantitative Method and Influencing Factors Analysis of Demand Response Performance of Air Conditioning Load with Rebound Effect**  
   Ran Wang, Xiaoyue Xin, Jiatao Liu, Shilei Lu*, Yunjun Sun, Wenduan Zhao  
   *Building Simulation*, Submitted July. 2024  
   **Abstract**: This study proposes a quantitative method to analyze the demand response performance of air conditioning loads, considering the rebound effect. The influencing factors are identified through sensitivity analysis.

### Conference Papers
1. **Combination of UV Radiation with 3D Structure Media Filter for Indoor Air Disinfection**  
   Jiatao Liu, Junjie Liu*, Yingying Fan, Pan Wang  
   *The 16th ROOMVENT Conference (ROOMVENT 2022)*, Aug. 2022  
   **Abstract**: This paper explores the effectiveness of combining UV radiation with a 3D structured media filter for indoor air disinfection. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in air quality.
